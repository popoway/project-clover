Who's the Queen of vday20?

## Quick Links
Production: http://clover.yeshan.ming.fyi  
Development: https://project-clover.app.popoway.cloud

## Motivation

We were thinking about getting an app / service to store our memories. Then it turned out that those apps on various markets are not that good, plus there are privacy and customization issues, etc. So here is the present for vday20.

## Self-hosting

Everything you need to host this app on your server is any server with PHP installed, plus SQLite extension support. The app consists of a few php files, a sqlite3 database, and static assets. You can download the latest distribution files from the [release page](https://github.com/popoway/project-clover/releases).

## Compatibility

The app should be running functionally on the latest 3 stable versions of Safari and Chrome.
